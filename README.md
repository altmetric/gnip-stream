`gnip-stream` is a ruby library to connect and stream JSON data from [GNIP](http://gnip.com/). It opens a connection to one of GNIP's JSON stream endpoints, and yields individual JSON packets back to the calling application.

The library can be used for receiving events from both the Powertrack API, which receives new posts, and the Compliance Firehose, which contains details of tweet and profile events that affect visibility and availability of tweet information.

## Installation

Add the following line to your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'gnip-stream', github: 'altmetric/gnip-stream'
```

## Usage

```ruby
require 'gnip-stream'

# To connect to the GNIP Powertrack API
twitter_stream = GnipStream::PowertrackClient.new('http://yourstreamingurl.gnip.com', 'someuser', 'password')
twitter_stream.consume do |message|
  # message will be a string representation of a JSON object
  puts message
end
```
